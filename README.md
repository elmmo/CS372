## Assumptions

1. Scanner 
This HW assignment assumes that every function should be written so it can be run anywhere on its own. Because every function requires user input, one Scanner is stored in a class variable and used for every function. 

2. stringToInt 
Assumes that `Character.getNumericValue` is okay to use for converting the string to an int value. 

3. Output 
Assumes that all functions should be tested via an external file with "Test" in the filename.
